## Getting Your Pinecone API Key

To use the functionalities provided in this repository, you will need a Pinecone API key. Follow these steps to generate and retrieve your API key:

1. **Sign Up or Log In to Pinecone**: If you haven't already, visit [Pinecone's website](https://www.pinecone.io) and sign up for an account or log in if you already have one.

2. **Create an Index (Optional)**: Once logged in, you might need to create an index if you haven't already. Click on "Create Index" to generate an index. This step is optional and based on your specific needs.

3. **Access API Keys**: Navigate to the Pinecone console dashboard. Look for the "API Keys" section in the navigation menu.

4. **Generate API Key**: In the API Keys section, you may see an option to generate a new API key. If it's your first time, Pinecone might automatically provide you with an API key. If you need to create a new one, click on the option to generate or create a new API key.

5. **Copy Your API Key**: Once your API key is generated, make sure to copy it. It's crucial to keep your API key secure and not share it publicly.

6. **Update the Program**: In the codebase of this repository, replace "your-api-key" with the API key you just copied. This will authenticate your requests to Pinecone's services.

Remember, your API key is like a password. Keep it secure and do not share it publicly. If you ever believe your API key has been compromised, you can regenerate a new one from the Pinecone console.
